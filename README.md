# Tokens of Victory Game

[Live Link](https://andreweharding.github.io/Tokens-of-Victory-Game/)

The game begins with a **Target Random Number** that the user must match. Each **Button** is given a random value at the start of a new game. Clicking each **Button** will add the button's value to the users score. On each click, the game will compare the users score to the **Target Random Number**. If the user score is equal to the **Target**, the game resets and the win counter is incremented by one. If the user score is over the **Target**, the game resets and the loss counter is incremented by one. On each reset, the **Target Random Number** and all **Button** values are changed. In addition, in keeping with the game's theme, there is a **Humanity Counter** that will increment with each win, but will drop back to zero upon a loss.
